- 👋 Hi, I’m Cadence 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Web development and developing software. I enjoy learning new things and hope to be ready for a career in tech soon! I would say I am more so a problem solver than a designer, but I am refining my skills in both each day. Outside of programming I enjoy reading, gaming, chess, meditation, and nature.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Web development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more soon. I have worked with Python and Java but have not mastered either. My first experience programming was in high school, and I learned C++. This course taught me the fundamentals and I loved it. Other goals have come and gone, but I have been rediscovering my passion for programming.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nearly anything!
