- 👋 Hi, I’m [2022 Tech Resume.docx](https://github.com/CadenceElaina/CadenceElaina/files/9105023/2022.Tech.Resume.docx)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Web development and developing software. I enjoy learning new things and hope to be ready for a career in tech soon! I would say I am more so a problem solver than a designer, so I imagine myself eventually becoming a software engineer, working on apps/games or nearly anything really. I do enjoy web design I just enjoy working with java or C++ more than JS and CSS. Outside of programming I enjoy reading, gaming, chess, meditation, and nature.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Web development through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have worked with Python and Java but have not mastered either. My first experience programming was in high school, and I learned C++. That was in 2015 or 2016 and unfortunately, I did not have a PC to program on outside of class. In class we used a windows PC. Our school was fortunate to provide every student with a MacBook air. My C++ teacher did offer to help us setup the programming environment necessary to code on the MacBook, but I didn't take her up on that offer. However, this course taught me the fundamentals and I loved it. Other careers and goals have come and gone, but I have found myself in recent years rediscovering my passion for programming.

- 10 Favorite Games All Time: 
1. Pokémon Emerald (I loved Fire Red, Gold, Platinum, and B&W, but stopped playing after B&W 2) - Great franchise 
2. Civilization 3 (civ V and VI are close in value to me)
3. League of Legends (only in theory, rarely in application) - the game itself is one of the best multiplayer experiences. Unfortunately, the community is terrible, and matchmaking is often questionable and the meta can be broken throughout the year, but when the meta is playable and you get an actual competitive game it’s a great experience.
4. Call of Duty - countless hours in multiplayer/competitive across titles and some of the older campaigns were fantastic.
5. Elder Scrolls - Skyrim
6. GTA V
7. Halo 3
8. Minecraft
9. Guitar Hero 3 
10. Super Mario World
