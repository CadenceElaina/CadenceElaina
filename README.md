- 👋 Hi, I’m Cadence 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Web development and developing software. I enjoy learning new things and hope to be ready for a career in tech soon! I would say I am more so a problem solver than a designer, but I am refining my skills in both each day. Outside of programming I enjoy reading, gaming, chess, meditation, and nature.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Web development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more soon. I have worked with Python and Java but have not mastered either. My first experience programming was in high school, and I learned C++. This course taught me the fundamentals and I loved it. Other goals have come and gone, but I have been rediscovering my passion for programming.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nearly anything!

Top 10 Favorite Games All Time: 
1. Pokémon Emerald (I loved Fire Red, Gold, Platinum, and B&W, but stopped playing after B&W 2) - Great franchise 
2. Civilization 3 (civ V and VI are close in value to me)
3. League of Legends (only in theory, rarely in application) - the game itself is one of the best multiplayer experiences. Unfortunately, the community is terrible, and matchmaking is often questionable and the meta can be broken throughout the year, but when the meta is playable and you get an actual competitive game it’s a great experience.
4. Call of Duty - countless hours in multiplayer/competitive across titles and some of the older campaigns were fantastic.
5. Elder Scrolls - Skyrim
6. GTA V
7. Halo 3
8. Minecraft
9. Guitar Hero 3 
10. Super Mario World
